                        This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer or
                        solicitation to
                        sell shares or securities in
                        FundRequest or any related or associated company. Any such offer or solicitation would be made

                        23 Further Information
                        The FND token
                        FND tokens are cryptographic tokens created by FundRequest only upon successful completion of
                        the
                        token sale. The token sale is successful
                        when the minimum cap ("Minimum Cap") is reached at the end of the token sale. The "Minimum Cap"
                        is
                        set at 2 million USD in Ethereum token
                        equivalent measured at the end of the token sale. Donations received during the private seed,
                        and
                        the public seed, and the strategic advisor
                        presale will be taken into account towards this Minimum Cap. Following their creation, FND
                        tokens
                        are transferred to Donors as an expression of
                        appreciation and gratitude and an acknowledgement of their support. FundRequest is not
                        accountable
                        should any Donor or Third Party attach
                        (monetary) value to the FND token.
                        The ownership of FND Tokens is a reward based return and not intended to be any form of loan
                        based
                        return. The digital token known as FND is
                        only useful for identifying your contribution to the crowdsale. This document describes the
                        FundRequest token sale. Parties may be interested in
                        donating funds in the token sale of FundRequest to support the development of the FundRequest
                        Platform. Individuals, businesses, and other
                        organisations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of donating funds to the
                        FundRequest project.
                        IMPORTANT
                        Donations to the FundRequest project carry no rights expressed or implied. Donations to the
                        FundRequest project are non-refundable.
                        Donors should have no expectation of influence over governance of the platform.
                        By participating in the token sale, you acknowledge and represent that you have carefully
                        reviewed
                        the Terms and fully understand the risks,
                        costs, and benefits of participating and agree to be bound by these Terms. As set forth further
                        below, you further represent and warrant that, to
                        the extent permitted by law, you are authorised to participate in the token sale in your
                        relevant
                        jurisdiction, are of a legal age to be bound by these
                        Terms, and will not hold FundRequest, its parents and affiliates, and the officers, directors,
                        agents, joint ventures, owners, founders, employees,
                        developers, volunteers and/or suppliers of FundRequest or our parents or affiliates, now or in
                        the
                        future and any other member of the
                        FundRequest Team (collectively all people who contribute to the FundRequest platform) liable for
                        any
                        losses or any special, incidental, or
                        consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to the token sale of FND.
                        WARNING: DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE TOKEN SALE IF YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT IN DEALING WITH
                        CRYPTOGRAPHIC
                        TOKENS
                        AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEMS
                        Participation in the token sale should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies
                        that have significant experience with, and
                        understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, such as, but not limited to
                        bitcoin (BTC), and blockchain-based software
                        systems.
                        While the FundRequest Team will provide general guidelines for user usage and storage of FND
                        before
                        the FundRequest Platform becomes
                        operational, Donors should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms
                        associated with other cryptographic tokens.
                        While the FundRequest Team will be available to assist Donors to FundRequest during and after
                        the
                        token sale, FundRequest will not be
                        responsible for lost ETH or FND resulting from actions taken by, or omitted by Donors. Note, in
                        particular, that FundRequest Donors should take
                        great care to store their wallet password safely to retain access to their FND tokens.
                        If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not participate in the FND
                        token
                        sale.
                        WARNING: CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS OF VALUE MAY EXPERIENCE EXTREME VOLATILITY IN PRICING
                        Cryptographic tokens that possess value on public exchanges, such as BTC, have demonstrated
                        extreme
                        fluctuations in price over short periods
                        of time on a regular basis. If the FND token would be listed on exchanges in the future, then
                        FND
                        Donors should be prepared to expect similar
                        fluctuations, both down and up, in the price of FND denominated in either another cryptocurrency
                        or
                        United States Dollars ("USD") or other fiat
                        money of other jurisdictions. Such fluctuations are due to market forces and represent changes
                        in
                        the balance of supply and demand.
                        FundRequest cannot and does not guarantee market liquidity for FND and therefore there may be
                        periods of time in which FND is difficult to buy
                        and/or sell. Additionally, due to different regulatory dictates in different jurisdictions and
                        the
                        inability of citizens of certain countries to open
                        accounts at exchanges located anywhere in the world, the liquidity of FND may be markedly
                        different
                        in various countries and this would likely be
                        reflected in significant price discrepancies.
                        By participating in the token sale, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you fully
                        understand that FND may experience volatility in pricing
                        and will not seek to hold any of the FundRequest Parties liable for any losses or any special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or
                        in any way connected to the token sale of FND.
                        WARNING: THE PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN SALE OF FND HAS A NUMBER OF RISKS
                        Donation to FundRequest in order to receive FND carries with it a number of risks. Prior to
                        donating, you should carefully consider the risks listed
                        below and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, or tax
                        professional.
                        If any of the following risks are unacceptable
                        to you, you should not participate in the token sale nor purchase FND. By participating in the
                        token
                        sale or purchasing FND, and to the extent
                        permitted by law, you are agreeing not to hold any of the FundRequest Parties liable for any
                        losses
                        or any special, incidental, or consequential
                        damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the token sale, including losses associated
                        with
                        the risks set forth below.
                        Obligation to Determine If Donator Can Participate in the Token Sale or
                        Purchase FND in Donor's Jurisdiction
                        The FundRequest token sale constitutes the donation of Ether to FundRequest under Estonian law.
                        This
                        token sale is conducted by
                        FundRequest OÜ, an Estonian organisation, operating under Estonian law. It is the responsibility
                        of
                        each potential Donor to FundRequest to
                        determine if the Donor can legally partake in the token sale and/or purchase FND in the
                        Donator's
                        jurisdiction.
                        The FundRequest token sale is an offer made by FundRequest OÜ in Estonia, Belgium and France (to
                        be
                        extended when legal analysis for other
                        countries are ready) for residents of these counries. Residents of other countries can only
                        partake
                        if, by law, the can partake to such an offer in Es
                        tonia, Belgium and France (to be extended when legal analysis for other countries are ready).

                        BTC, and blockchain-based software systems.
                        Independent Confirmation of Donation
                        During the donation process on the https://www.fundrequest.io website, FundRequest will provide
                        Donors with a unique intermediary ETH
                        address. Using this address, Donors can track and confirm that the donated ETH have been
                        received at
                        that address.
                        Knowledge of the unique intermediary ETH address does not constitute a purchase receipt or
                        indicate
                        in any way that any party possessing such
                        knowledge has rights to or ownership of the granted FND.
                        Loss of the Donation Password Will Cause the Loss of the right to receive FND
                        As part of the donation process, and in order to receive FND, the Donor will need to provide an
                        ETH
                        address ("Donor ETH address"). Failing to do
                        so will result in the inability to donate to the FundRequest project. Upon succesful completion
                        of
                        the token sale, and only then, will FundRequest
                        transfer the granted FND tokens to the Donor ETH Address. The token sale is succesful when the
                        Minimum Cap is reached.
                        Donor must keep the Donation ETH address Password safe and not share it in any way or with
                        anybody.
                        The Donator ETH address Password is
                        essential for accessing the Donor's FND. Donor's loss of the Donation ETH address Password will
                        cause the loss of the aquired FND.
                        Unauthorised access by any party to a Donor's ETH address Password along with access to the
                        Ethereum
                        wallet, will enable that unauthorised
                        party to access the received FND and the FND will be lost.
                        Donor must keep the Donation ETH address Password safe and not share it in any way or with
                        anybody.
                        The Donator ETH address Password is
                        essential for accessing the Donor's FND. Donor's loss of the Donation ETH address Password will
                        cause the loss of the aquired FND.
                        Unauthorised access by any party to a Donor's ETH address Password along with access to the
                        Ethereum
                        wallet, will enable that unauthorised
                        party to access the received FND and the FND will be lost.
                        By partaking in the token sale or by purchasing FND, and to the extent permitted by applicable
                        law,
                        the Donor agrees not to hold any of the
                        FundRequest Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages
                        arising out of, or in any way connected to, Donor's
                        failure to properly secure and keep private the Donor's ETH address Password and/or the Donor's
                        Ethereum wallet.
                        Donations will only be accepted by the FundRequest Website
                        FundRequest will only accept donations through the FundRequest website, available at
                        https://www.fundrequest.io. To the extent that any
                        third-party website or service offers FND for sale during the FundRequest token sale or
                        facilitates
                        the sale or transfer of FND in any way during
                        the FundRequest token sale, such third-party websites or services are not sanctioned by
                        FundRequest
                        or its parents and affiliates and have no
                        relationship in any way with the FundRequest Parties. As a result, FundRequest prohibits the use
                        of
                        these third-party websites or services for the
                        purchase of FND.
                        Donors should take great care to ensure that the URL of their web browser indicates that it is
                        using
                        a hypertext transport protocol secure
                        connection ("https") and that the domain name is correct.
                        By partaking in the token sale or by purchasing FND, and to the extent permitted by applicable
                        law,
                        the Donor agrees not to hold any of the
                        FundRequest Parties liable for losses incurred by any person, entity, corporation, or group
                        individuals or groups who uses a third party service to
                        purchase FND.
                        The only official and authorised FND donation website URL is https://www.fundrequest.io
                        Fraudulent Attempts to Double Spend ETH
                        FundRequest will monitor all potential transactions for fraudulent attempts to double spend ETH.
                        Any
                        detected double spend of ETH will result in
                        no FND being transferred to the associated wallet address.
                        Certain Risks Associated with the Donation to FundRequest in order to receive
                        FND
                        Donating to FundRequest in order to receive FND tokens carries with it significant risk. Prior
                        to
                        partaking in the token sale or by purchasing FND,
                        the Donor should carefully consider the below risks and, to the extent necessary, consult a
                        lawyer,
                        accountant, and/or tax professional prior to
                        determine whether to partake in the token sale or the purchase of FND.
                        Risk of Dissolution of The FundRequest Project Due To a Diminishment in the Value of
                        the ETH Sale Revenue
                        All Donors are donating ETH to support the FundRequest project. In the past few months the price
                        of
                        ETH in USD and EUR has been relatively
                        stable. However, despite recent price stability, it is possible that the value of ETH will drop
                        significantly in the future, depriving FundRequest of
                        sufficient resources to continue to operate. In order to guard against this risk, FundRequest
                        intends to periodically convert proceeds from the toke
                        n sale of FND into fiat currencies or other cryptocoins instead of ETH. In order to cover the
                        initial startup costs, FundRequest will convert 175.000
                        USD worth of Ether to fiat after a successful token sale.
                        Risk of Losing Access to FND Due to Loss of a Wallet File or Password
                        As noted above, FND will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password
                        selected
                        by the Donor. If a Donor of FND does not
                        maintain an accurate record of the Donor's password or loses the wallet, this will lead to the
                        loss
                        of FND.
                        As a result, Donor must safely store their password and the wallet in one or more backup
                        locations
                        that are well separated from the primary
                        location. Additionally the password and the wallet should never be stored together.
                        In order to access one's FND, both the wallet and the password that the Donor entered are
                        required;
                        loss of either, or leakage/theft of both, will
                        lead to the loss of a Donor's FND.
                        Risk of Unauthorised Access to a Wallet
                        Any third party that gains access to the Donor's Ethereum wallet and potentially access the
                        wallet
                        by deciphering or cracking the Donor's
                        password. To guard against any improper access to the wallet, the Donor should select a highly
                        secure Donation Password for the Donation
                        wallet. Donor must take care not to respond to any inquiry regarding their donation to
                        FundRequest,
                        including but not limited to, email requests
                        purportedly coming from the fundrequest.io or similar looking domain.
                        Risk of Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions
                        Cryptocurrencies have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny by various regulatory bodies
                        around
                        the globe. The FundRequest Platform and
                        FND could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could
                        impede
                        or limit the ability of the FundRequest Team
                        to continue to develop the FundRequest Platform.
                        Risk of Insufficient Interest in the FundRequest Platform
                        It is possible that the FundRequest Platform will not be used by a large number of external
                        businesses, individuals, and other organisations and
                        that there will be limited public interest in supporting the open source community via our
                        platform.
                        Such a lack of interest could impact the
                        development of the FundRequest Platform. FundRequest has contracted with developers to help
                        build
                        the FundRequest Platform and is working
                        with other third-party developers around the world to create an interest in the FundRequest
                        Platform. However, it cannot predict the success of its
                        own development efforts or the efforts of third parties.
                        Risk Associated With the Development of Other Platforms like FundRequest
                        FundRequest is one of a few organisations, companies, and groups, attempting to build a platform
                        for
                        rewarding open source contributions. It is
                        possible that different technical paradigms than the ones being used in the current FundRequest
                        Platform implementation are optimal.
                        While FundRequest anticipates being a leader in the development of such a platform, competition
                        from
                        these alternative platforms may impact
                        success of the FundRequest Project and the ability of FundRequest to operate.
                        Risk that the FundRequest Platform, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of Don
                        or
                        The Donor recognises that the FundRequest Platform is presently under development and may
                        undergo
                        significant changes before release. Dono
                        r acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the FundRequest
                        Platform held by the Donor may not be met upon
                        release of the FundRequest Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design
                        and
                        implementation plans and execution of the
                        implementation of the FundRequest Platform.
                        Risk that the FundRequest Platform May Never be Completed or Released
                        Donor understands, that while the FundRequest Team will make reasonable efforts to complete the
                        FundRequest software, it is possible that an
                        official completed version of the FundRequest Platform may not be released and there may never
                        be an
                        operational FundRequest Platform.
                        Risk of Theft
                        Hackers or other groups or organisations may attempt to steal the ETH revenue from the
                        FundRequest
                        private seed, public seed and/or token
                        sale, thus potentially impacting the ability of FundRequest to develop the FundRequest Platform
                        and
                        operate FundRequest. To account for this
                        risk, FundRequest has and will continue to implement comprehensive security precautions to
                        safeguard
                        the ETH obtained from the private seed,
                        public seed and/or token sale of FND.
                        Risk of Security Weaknesses in the FundRequest Platform Software
                        The FundRequest Platform rests on open source software, and there is a risk that the FundRequest
                        Team, or other third parties not directly
                        affiliated with the FundRequest Parties, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core
                        infrastructural elements of the FundRequest Platform
                        causing the system to lose ETH or FND stored in one or more Donor accounts or other accounts or
                        lose
                        sums of other valued tokens issued on
                        the FundRequest Platform.
                        FundRequest has taken steps to build, maintain, and secure the infrastructure of the FundRequest
                        Platform, and will continue to do so after the
                        FundRequest private seed, public seed and token sale.
                        Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography
                        Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers,
                        could
                        present risks to cryptocurrencies and
                        the FundRequest Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of ETH or FND. To the extent
                        possible, FundRequest intends to update the
                        protocol underlying the FundRequest Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to
                        incorporate additional security measures, but
                        cannot predict the future of cryptography or the success of any future security updates.
                        Risk of Ether Mining Attacks
                        As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the FundRequest Platform, Ethereum is
                        susceptible to mining attacks, including but not
                        limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, "selfish-mining" attacks, and
                        race
                        condition attacks. Any successful attacks
                        present a risk to the FundRequest Platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of ETH
                        transactions, and expected proper execution and
                        sequencing of contract computations. Despite the efforts of the Ethereum community, known or
                        novel
                        mining attacks may be successful.
                        Risk of Rapid Adoption and Insufficiency of Computational Application Processing Power
                        on the FundRequest Network
                        If the FundRequest Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing could rise
                        dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the
                        supporting rate. Under such a scenario, the entire FundRequest Platform could become
                        destabilised
                        causing time-outs and delays in the
                        transactions.
                        All Donations during the token sale and the Purchases of FundRequest tokens
                        (FND) Are Non-Refundable
                        ALL DONATIONS ARE FINAL AND NON REFUNDABLE. ALL PURCHASES OF FND TOKENS ARE FINAL. PURCHASES OF
                        FND
                        ARE
                        NON-REFUNDABLE. BY PARTAKING IN THE TOKE SALE AND/OR PURCHASING FND, THE DONOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
                        NEITHER
                        FUNDREQUEST NOR ANY OTHER OF THE FUNDREQUEST PARTIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY
                        REASON, AND
                        THAT THE DONOR AND/OR PURCHASER WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR ANY FND. ONCE
                        THE
                        DONOR
                        RECEIVES HIS OR HER TOKENS AFTER THE TOKEN SALE, THEY ARE FREE TO SEND OR SELL THEM TO ANYONE OF
                        THEIR CHOICE.
                        Taxation of FND token and Taxation Related to the FundRequest Token Sale
                        FundRequest makes no representations concerning the tax implications of the donations to
                        FundRequest
                        or the sale of FND or the possession or
                        use of FND. The Donor bears the sole responsibility to determine if the donation to FundRequest
                        and/or the purchase of FND with ETH or the
                        potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of FND over time has tax implications for
                        the
                        Donor in the Donor's home jurisdiction.
                        By donating to FundRequest or purchasing FND, and to the extent permitted by law, the Donor
                        agrees
                        not hold any of the FundRequest Parties
                        liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the donation to FundRequest or the
                        purchase of FND.
                        Privacy
                        Although FundRequest requires that Donors provide an Ethereum address and KYC information,
                        FundRequest will not publish any identifying
                        information related to a FundRequest donation or a FND purchase without the prior written
                        consent of
                        the Donor. Donors may be contacted by
                        email by FundRequest regarding a donation or a purchase. Such emails will be informational only.
                        FundRequest will not request any personal
                        information from Donors in an email.

                        Limitations Waiver of Liability
                        THE DONOR ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW,

                        Dispute Resolution
                        All disputes, controversies or claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the
                        Terms,
                        the breach thereof, or FundRequest's token sale of
                        FND or use of the FundRequest Platform shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration
                        of
                        the International Chamber of Commerce by one
                        or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with said Rules. All claims between the parties
                        relating
                        to these Terms that are capable of being
                        resolved by arbitration, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be submitted to
                        ICC
                        arbitration.
                        Prior to commencing arbitration, the parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith and attempt
                        to
                        resolve their dispute in a manner other than by
                        submission to ICC arbitration.
                        The arbitration panel shall consist of one arbitrator only, unless the ICC Court of Arbitration
                        determines that the dispute is such as to warrant three
                        arbitrators. If the Court determines that one arbitrator is sufficient, then such arbitrator
                        shall
                        be selected from Belgium. If the Court determines that
                        three arbitrators are necessary, then each party shall have 30 days to nominate an arbitrator of
                        its
                        choice — in the case of the Claimant,
                        measured from receipt of notification of the ICC Court's decision to have three arbitrators; in
                        the
                        case of Respondent, measured from receipt of
                        notification of Claimant's nomination. All nominations must be from Belgium. If a party fails to
                        nominate an arbitrator, the Court will do so. The
                        Court shall also appoint the chairman.
                        All arbitrators shall be and remain "independent" of the parties involved in the arbitration.
                        The
                        place of arbitration shall be fixed by the ICC Court,
                        but the arbitral tribunal may conduct hearings, meetings, and deliberations at any location it
                        considers appropriate. The language of the arbitration
                        shall be English. In deciding the merits of the dispute, the tribunal shall apply the laws of
                        Belgium and any discovery shall be limited and shall not
                        involve any depositions or any other examinations outside of a formal hearing. The tribunal
                        shall
                        not assume the powers of amiable compositor or
                        decide the case ex aequo et bono.
                        In the final award, the tribunal shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the
                        parties shall bear such costs in what proportion. Every
                        award shall be binding on the parties. The parties undertake to carry out the award without
                        delay
                        and waive their right to any form of recourse
                        against the award in so far as such waiver can validly be made.
                        Force Majeure
                        FundRequest is not liable for failure to perform solely caused by:
                        unavoidable casualty, delays in delivery of materials, embargoes, government orders, acts of
                        civil
                        or military authorities, acts by common carriers,
                        emergency conditions (including weather conditions) incompatible with safety or good quality
                        workmanship, or any similar unforeseen event that
                        renders performance commercially implausible. If an event of force majeure occurs, the party
                        injured
                        by the other's inability to perform may elect
                        to suspend the Agreement, in whole or part, for the duration of the force majeure circumstances.
                        The
                        party experiencing the force majeure
                        circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the injured party in all reasonable ways to
                        minimise
                        the impact of force majeure on the injured
                        party.
                        Complete Agreement
                        These Terms sets forth the entire understanding between each Donor and FundRequest with respect
                        to
                        the donation to FundRequest.
                        For facts relating to the token sale the Donor agrees to rely only on this document in
                        determining
                        donation decisions and understands that this
                        document governs the donation to FundRequest and supersede any public statements about the
                        FundRequest token sale made by third parties
                        or by FundRequest Team or individuals associated with any FundRequest Parties, past and present
                        and
                        during the FundRequest private seed,
                        public seed, and token sale.
                        Severability
                        The Donor and FundRequest agree that if any portion of these Terms is found illegal or
                        unenforceable, in whole or in part, the Terms will be
                        ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity without affecting the
                        validity
                        or enforceability thereof in any other manner or
                        jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall continue
                        to be
                        in full force and effect.
                        Waiver of liability of the FundRequest team
                        The founders, members and employees of FundRequest have no personal liability for any harm or
                        loss
                        to a Donor caused by partaking in the
                        private seed, public seed and/or token sale.
                        No Waiver
                        The failure of FundRequest to require or enforce strict performance by the Donor of any
                        provision of
                        these Terms or FundRequest's failure to
                        exercise any right under these agreements shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment
                        of
                        FundRequest's right to assert or rely upon any
                        such provision or right in that or any other instance.
                        The express waiver by FundRequest of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms
                        shall
                        not constitute a waiver of any future
                        obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.
                        Except as expressly and specifically set forth in this these Terms, no representations,
                        statements,
                        consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions
                        by FundRequest shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor be legally binding, unless
                        documented in physical writing, hand signed by
                        the Donor and a duly appointed officer, employee, or agent of FundRequest.
                        Updates to the Terms and Conditions of the FundRequest Token Sale
                        FundRequest reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove
                        portions
                        of the Terms & Conditions at any time during
                        the token sale by posting the amended Terms & Conditions on the FundRequest website
                        (https://www.fundrequest.io). Any Donor will be deemed
                        to have accepted such changes by donating to FundRequest.
                        The Terms may not be otherwise amended except in a signed writing executed by both the Donor and
                        FundRequest. For purposes of this
                        agreement, "writing" does not include an e-mail message and a signature does not include an
                        electronic signature.
                        If at any point you do not agree to any portion of the then-current version of the Terms, you
                        should
                        not donate to FundRequest nor purchase FND.
                        To the extent the Terms conflict with the FND Disclaimer, the Terms shall govern.
                        Cooperation with Legal Authorities
                        FundRequest will cooperate with all law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas, or requests provided
                        they
                        are fully supported and documented by the
                        law in the relevant jurisdictions. In accord with one of the core principles of the FundRequest
                        project — transparency — FundRequest will
                        endeavour to publish any legal inquiries upon receipt.
                        Conflicting terms and conditions with applicable legislation
                        If one of the terms and conditions would be in conflict with the applicable legislation only the
                        conflicting term and/or condition is nullified but the
                        other terms and conditions remain applicable.
